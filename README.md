Regack's 59% Keyboard
=====

A reduced size keyboard, but not quite 60%.


This is the extended version of the 59% keyboard.  

* You can safely cut off the number pad section to remove the last 4 columns.  
* Locate the two small ground pads at the top and the bottom of the board.  
* Score along both front and back, and snap it off.

Finally fixed the missing trace on S05:1 - on the ones I built I just soldered on a wire to bridge the missing gap.
