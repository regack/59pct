# 59pct
A reduced size keyboard, but not quite 60%.

This is the extended version of the 59% keyboard.  

You can safely cut off the number pad section to remove the last 4 columns.  
Locate the two small ground pads at the top and the bottom of the board.  
Score along both front and back, and snap it off.
